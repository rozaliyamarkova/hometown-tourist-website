              <strong>Roman Times</strong>
            </div>
            <div> The region around Montana became part of the Roman province of Upper Moesia in 29 BC. Around 160 AD, a military camp that was most likely founded on the remains of an older Thracian settlement acquired city rights under the name of Civitas Montanensium. [12] The town developed and urbanized after a Roman model and became the second most important settlement in the province after Raciaria (near modern-day Archar). The fortress of Castra ad Montanesium was built atop the hill overlooking Montana, as well as public and residential buildings, temples, baths and theatres. Montana became a typical imperial settlement, where the local Romanized population coexisted alongside Italic and Anatolian settlers. The base of the town's economy was the big landowners of Italic origin and their villas and mansions, while the locals served to work in agricultural production and gold mining in the Ogosta river valley. A community of Greek settlers engaged in craftsmanship and money-lending lived in the town during the period. The patrons of Montana, in the spirit of Hellenism, were Diana and Apollo. </div>

            </div>
            <div> Between 440 and 490, the northwest of modern Bulgaria was devastated by the raids of the Huns, under Attila, and later by the Goths. Slavs and Avars delivered the final blow to Greco-Roman culture in the region. The Slavs who settled later in the area called the town Kutlovitsa. During the time of the First and Second Bulgarian Empires, the settlement recovered and became the centre of an eparchy. The town was first mentioned in Byzantine sources under the name of Montanesium in the 11th century. The town was a key fortress of the Bulgarian Empire and a major centre of the First and the Second Bulgarian Empire. The town was mentioned under the Slavic name of Kutlovitsa in a 1075 charter by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas. In the 13th century, the town was included in the Empire of Nicaea under the name of Montanesium. </div>

            </div>
            <div> After Kutlovitsa was seized by the Ottomans, the settlement was destroyed and became deserted. It was renamed "Kutlofça" by the Ottomans, which was derived from Kutlovitsa. Between 1450 and 1688, the town was resettled by Turks because of its strategic location, and went through another period of blossoming as a typically Oriental town. A mosque, fountains, and other new buildings were erected. There was also a Roman Bath left over from the Middle Ages. </div>

              <strong>Modern History</strong>
            </div>
            <div> After the Liberation, a massive population migration to Kutlovitsa began. The first group to settle in the city were farmers from the area of Belimel and Mitrovtsi. There followed a large wave of immigrants from Berkovsko and after 1912 - immigrants from Tsaribrodsko, Godechko, Sofia, Troyansko, as well as from Macedonia. Along with the influx of population after 1878, the city's infrastructure developed rapidly. An electrical network, a railway station, a post office, a hospital are built, a fair and a community center are started in the city. The city was one of the centers of the September Uprising of 1923, an unsuccessful rebellion organized by the Bulgarian Communist Party (Narrow Socialists) (BKP (t.s.)) under pressure from the Comintern. The rioters took over the city and briefly staged a coup. After September 9, 1944, there was a mass uniform migration to Montana from all the settlements in the then Mihailovgrad district. The city experienced an economic boom and strongly developed as an industrial center. During this period, a battery plant, 2 machine building plants, a tool plant, a spinning mill, a floor ceramic plant and fittings were built. </div>
